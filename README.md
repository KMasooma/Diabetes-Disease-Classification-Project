Diabetes Data Classification Project
This project focuses on classifying diabetes using a dataset of 768 instances and 8 key features. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling using a Decision Tree algorithm to achieve a robust classification performance.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to classify whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. Through data preprocessing, analysis, and predictive modeling, the project aims to improve model accuracy and interpretability.

Key Features
Total Data Points: 768
Features: 8 key features (e.g., pregnancies, glucose levels, BMI, etc.)
Target: Binary classification - Diabetic (1) or Non-diabetic (0)
Steps Involved
1. Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning: Managed missing values and outliers.
Feature Scaling: Standardized data for model consistency.
Feature Selection: Selected the 6 most significant features for the final model, improving the performance.
2. Data Analysis and Visualization
In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigated the distribution of features and relationships using visualizations.
Feature Importance: Analyzed feature importance to understand their contribution to the model's performance.
3. Predictive Modeling
